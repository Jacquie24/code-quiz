# code-quiz

## Description
The goal of this project was to create a timed quiz.  The user must answer the questions in the time allotted.  If they answer a question incorrectly, then 10 seconds is subtracted from the time.  At the end of the quiz, the user has an opportunity to submit their high scores. 


## Issues
Unfortunately, I have not gotten far in this project.  Though I am able to generate the initial questions, I have not reconciled the clicked answers with the actual answers to determine if the user is correct or not.  I also have not started on the timer element of the project.  I do have most of the Welcome screen functioning, and the initial screen clears to reveal the first question.

The rest will have to wait until I can finish coding the page.
